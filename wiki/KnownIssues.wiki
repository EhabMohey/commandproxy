= Screenshot does not work on mac =

The screenshot command currently does not work on Mac, and fails with the following error:

{{{Error taking screenshot}}}

The underlying error message is:

{{{An exception was thrown by the type initializer for System.Windows.Forms.Screen}}}

This appears to be an issue with the mono framework /  runtime.
